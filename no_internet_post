writing this offline because i'm sitting at the desk without internet.  no where to self dictate so i'm pretending
to be a writer.  it'd make sense to do this job as a writer sort of.  the rental business is super cool.  remember that and focus on that.  enlightenment is seeing the path but then also running down it.
i'm liking the cheekbones. 2 days now.  back to at least attractive levels, need to move to super attractive soon.  keep your head down and make the sharing app.  another session and it'll be more complicated than most places can do quickly.
then you're showing it to jackie and brennan while getting thinner each day.  i can see more angles in your face in the light.  be hot and quiet.
when everything is spinning up the hc will accrue stuff.  like everytyihng for free can be stored here.
so the hc is the beneficiary of the program.  which adds more for the front desk to do but they can get paid more too.

little sad watching all the new rich.  a lot's been happening.  haven't been social.  but everyone sharing things is harmony.  trading energy.
really nice not to feel a need to talk to people.  just nice and helpful, out of the way.
you need to lose this weight.  this is a start.  i can see angles in the reflection.  this is the foundation.  you can do this job.  you've figured out the ultimate technology,
learned how to create the ultimate business.
it's tricky so lets break down the process.  we'll be an expert in this.

face progress good.  showing losses.  must be in ketosis so should show good progress from here on out.
the flow will become smaller.  more people add and participate, everyone's place effectively becomes a storage space.  internet's back on.
